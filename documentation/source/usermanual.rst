A guided tour through the Jedli tool box
========================================

The main window of the Jedli tool box contains four key elements:

1. the menu bar
2. the “search term” frame
3. the “input and output” frame
4. the frames for the three main Jedli tools: the Indexer, the Highlighter, and the Context Search

For any search, you should select

1. one or more search terms,
2. one or more sources you want to search,
3. a folder where the results of your search will be saved,
4. and the type of search you want to carry out.

Upon launching the program, a second window appears next to the main window: the Jedli logger. In this window, you can follow what the program is doing.

You can close the logger if you do not need it and re‐open it at any time by clicking “Display Jedli Logger” in the View menu.


Selecting search terms 
======================

There are a couple of ways to select search terms in Jedli:
1. You can simply type a search term (in Arabic) in the entry fields. Search terms can consist of one or more words. 
2. Clicking the “Add more search words” button will give you more entry fields to add search terms
3. You can use the Boolean values AND, OR and NOT in the following ways:
   - NOT: exclude these search terms from the results
   - OR: add the search term(s) in this field to the search terms in the preceding field. In the highlighter, these will be highlighted in the same colour as those in the preceding field; in the context search, any result will need to match a search term that is in either this field or the preceding one 
   - AND: in the context search, any result will match a search term in both fields 
4. In each entry field, you can type more than one search term, divided by a hyphen (“‐”). For example, if you write "البحر الأخضر-بحر فارس", Jedli will return results that contain either البحر الأخضر or بحر فارس.
   NB: take care not to include additional spaces between the search terms and the hyphens.
5. You can also employ user‐defined checklists of search terms. These checklists are simple text documents (.txt files) that contain one search term on every new line (for more on checklists, see below). You can open a checklist by clicking the “select checklist” button. This will open a standard “open file” dialog from which you can select your checklist
