Quick start guide
=================

Jedli is a data mining tool box, designed to get more out of digitized Arabic texts.

Getting started with Jedli
--------------------------

1. Download the zipped Jedli archive from the website: https://www.islamic?empire.uni?hamburg.de/en/publications?tools/digital?tools/downloads/jedli?toolbox.html
2. Unzip the Jedli archive and save the Jedli folder on your computer
3. In the Jedli folder, double?click the jedli_main.exe file to launch the program. When you launch it the first time, Jedli might take around a minute to install itself.

Jedli currently contains three main tools
-----------------------------------------

- The Indexer: creates customized index files for any number of words in any number of sources.
- The Highlighter: highlights the words the user provided in a text, in order to facilitate retrieving relevant information from lengthy texts; different colors can be used for different (sets of) search terms, allowing the user to create personal color schemes.
- The Context Search: allows you to limit your search results to relevant contexts, based on user?defined checklists.

More tools will be added later to the tool box. Contact us if you would like to see another feature.

The advantages of Jedli over other tools
----------------------------------------

- *checklists of search terms*: you can create lists with an unlimited number of search terms, which you can use repeatedly for search operations.
- allows you to use separate, highly customizable *search options* for each search term.
- allows you to create your own *source selections* (based on genres, time periods, …).
- allows you to *save all your search results*

Adding texts to Jedli
---------------------

Jedli comes with a small number of sample texts; more texts can be downloaded from our website, or added by the user (see the manual).
